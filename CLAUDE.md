# CLAUDE.md — ims.tutorials

`ims.tutorials` is a tutorial package, one tutorial per chapter of
*Introduction to Modern Statistics*, covering the concepts of an
**introductory statistics course** — distributions, sampling,
estimation, uncertainty, regression, and the rest — worked through in R.
It is organized and maintained like
[`vscode.tutorials`](https://github.com/PPBDS/vscode.tutorials) —
tutorials in `inst/tutorials/`, launched from the R Tutorials extension,
checked by tests and a CI render in the student image — but it is built
on **[learnr2](https://github.com/PPBDS/learnr2)** (development version,
via `Remotes:`), not learnr or tutorial.helpers.

## Read first: ai-rules

The rules for writing tutorials live in
**[PPBDS/ai-rules](https://github.com/PPBDS/ai-rules)** (locally:
[`../ai-rules/`](https://ppbds.github.io/ai-rules/)), not here. Read, in
order:

1.  [`claude-md/CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/PPBDS/ai-rules/blob/main/claude-md/CLAUDE.md)
    — the map of which guide governs which package.
2.  [`claude-md/tutorials/CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/PPBDS/ai-rules/blob/main/claude-md/tutorials/CLAUDE.md)
    ([local](https://ppbds.github.io/ai-rules/claude-md/tutorials/CLAUDE.md))
    — the **base tutorial guide**: the AI-era philosophy, exercise
    rhythm, knowledge drops (at most two sentences), submission
    evidence, and formatting. It governs every tutorial here.

This file adds only what is specific to `ims.tutorials`. On anything
both cover, the base guide wins unless an override is recorded below.
When a lesson learned here applies to every tutorial package, fix it in
ai-rules rather than here. The local checkout may be ahead of GitHub;
prefer it when both exist.

## Companion book: *Introduction to Modern Statistics*

Our guide for constructing tutorials is **[*Introduction to Modern
Statistics*](https://openintrostat.github.io/ims/)** (2nd edition) by
Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin, free online under a [Creative
Commons BY-SA 3.0
license](https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/ims/blob/main/LICENSE.md). It
decides what we teach, in what order, and with what vocabulary. The
license covers the book’s figures as well as its text, so we may use
both, with attribution. It does not cover OpenIntro’s branding, logo, or
book covers. Because the license is ShareAlike, the figures and
sentences we copy stay under CC BY-SA 3.0 while the rest of the package
is MIT. `inst/COPYRIGHTS`, the DESCRIPTION `Copyright:` field, and
`LICENSE.md` record this.

How the book shapes a tutorial:

- **Each tutorial is a companion to specific chapters.** Per the base
  guide’s companion-text rule, the tutorial’s first sentence names and
  links the exact chapter, not just the book.
- **Knowledge drops pull key points from that chapter** (the base
  guide’s first kind of drop). Students usually won’t read the chapter,
  so the tutorial is where its main ideas reach them. Use the book’s
  terms (*sampling distribution*, *standard error*, *point estimate*)
  exactly as it defines them.
- **Follow the book’s order.** Never quiz a concept the book introduces
  in a later chapter.
- **Simulation before formulas.** The book teaches inference first
  through randomization and the bootstrap (Part 4) and only then through
  the normal model. Tutorials should do the same: students simulate
  first, then check the result against the formula.
- **Data comes from the chapter.** Every dataset a tutorial uses is one
  the chapter itself uses, so the tutorial and the chapter tell the same
  story. Most are in the
  **[openintro](https://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/)** R package
  (also **usdata**, **cherryblossom**, **palmerpenguins**); add any
  package used to `Suggests`. When the chapter gives its data only as a
  table or counts (the Brexit poll in Chapter 6, the medical
  consultant’s 3 of 62 in Chapter 12), build it as a small CSV with the
  chapter’s exact numbers, shipped in `inst/extdata/` and in the
  tutorial’s `data/` directory (see *Adding a tutorial*). Do not reach
  for a dataset from another chapter or from outside the book, and never
  use data the book simulates (Chapter 6’s Duke hires).
- **Use the book’s own words.** The book’s license lets us copy its
  text, and the more of the book that reaches students through the
  tutorial, the better. The limit is the reader, not the license: a
  knowledge drop is still at most two sentences, so the job is to pick
  the chapter’s *best* two sentences for each exercise. The exception is
  the chapter’s own Summary paragraph, which appears whole in the
  tutorial’s Summary section (see *One tutorial per chapter*).
  - **No quotation marks.** Copy the book’s sentences as our own prose,
    not as quotations: “A *summary statistic* is a single number
    summarizing data from a sample.”, not “‘A summary statistic is a
    single number summarizing data from a sample.’” Adjust only what the
    new context needs: case, punctuation, a pronoun, a singular for a
    plural. Italicize a term where the book defines it in bold.
  - **Acknowledge once.** The Summary’s last paragraph credits the book
    for every sentence and figure in the tutorial (see *One tutorial per
    chapter*), so no single sentence or figure carries its own credit.
  - **Other sources keep their quotation marks.** A help page (“were
    from a variety of sources”), a paper, or a study’s own words is
    quoted as usual.
- **Use the book’s figures.** Students skip a third sentence but look at
  a figure, so a knowledge drop may be one of the book’s figures plus at
  most two sentences. Use most of a chapter’s *diagrams*: figures that
  teach a concept no dataset produces, like Chapter 1’s tree of variable
  types or Chapter 2’s sampling pictures. Place each in the drop of the
  exercise whose output it explains, with sentences that tie the figure
  to that output. Never copy a plot of data or a table as an image. If a
  tutorial wants one, it builds it from R code, in an exercise or our
  answer chunk.
  - **Source.** Most of the book’s figures are drawn by R code. The
    rendered files are committed in the [book’s
    repo](https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/ims) at
    `_freeze/<chapter>/figure-html/<label>-1.png`, and a few hand-made
    ones are in `images/`. The HTML renders are 600 dpi and up to 6000
    px wide, so shrink each so its longer side is 1600 px
    (`sips -Z 1600`, never enlarging) and compress it
    (`pngquant --quality=80-95 --strip`). A line diagram ends up around
    10 to 50 KB, one with photos up to about 250 KB.

  - **File.** Save it as `inst/tutorials/<slug>/images/<label>.png`,
    keeping the book’s figure label (`fig-variables.png`). Where the
    book’s chunk label has no `fig-` prefix (`normTail-51`), add one
    (`fig-normTail-51.png`). A multi-panel figure’s single panel keeps
    its panel number (`fig-outlier-plots-2.png`). If the package path
    (`ims.tutorials/inst/tutorials/<slug>/images/<file>`) would pass 100
    bytes, shorten the label after `fig-` (`fig-95PercentCI.png` for the
    book’s `fig-95PercentConfidenceInterval`). R CMD check flags longer
    paths, and a test enforces the limit. `inst/COPYRIGHTS` covers every
    `images/fig-*.png` by that name, so a book figure must use it and
    nothing else may. A photo the book credits to someone else under its
    own license, like the possum in Chapter 7, is not the book’s to
    give, so leave it out.

  - **Markup.** A Markdown image with no caption, since the Summary’s
    acknowledgment credits it. Its `fig-alt` is the book’s own alt text:

    ``` markdown
    ![](images/fig-variables.png){fig-alt="Types of variables are broken down into numerical (which can be discrete or continuous) and categorical (which can be ordinal or nominal)."}
    ```
- **The book shows no R code.** It teaches concepts with tables and
  figures. Our tutorials supply the R work, done by students with AI in
  `analysis.qmd`.

OpenIntro also publishes learnr tutorials and R labs for the book
([openintro.org/book/ims](https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/)), built
on the **tidyverse** and **infer**. They are useful for seeing which
exercises the authors pair with each chapter. They follow a different
philosophy (students type code into exercise chunks), so do not copy
their structure.

### One tutorial per chapter

- **Each chapter gets exactly one tutorial**, in the book’s order. Its
  directory is a slug of the chapter title, with no chapter-number
  prefix, and its title is the chapter title in Title Case: Chapter 1,
  “Hello data,” is `hello-data`, titled “Hello Data,” with work repo
  `hello-data`. Its place in the list comes from the chapter number, set
  in the YAML header as `learnr2:` / `ordering: <chapter>` (Chapter 1
  sets `ordering: 1`). Shorten the slug when the full one would push a
  package path past 100 bytes, the limit for portable tarballs, which R
  CMD check flags as a NOTE. In practice keep the directory name to 33
  characters or fewer: Chapter 7 is `linear-regression-single` and
  Chapter 8 is `linear-regression-multiple`. Only the directory is
  shortened; the title and the work repo still come from the full
  chapter title.
- **60 minutes or less**, which generally means **around 40 questions**.
  A chapter with more material than that gets its most important ideas,
  not all of them.
- **At most two topics.** Per the *Tutorials in the Age of AI* article
  (see the base guide’s *Sources*), a one-hour AI tutorial has at most
  two topics between the Introduction and the Summary. Follow the
  chapter’s sections in order, merging them into two topics when the
  chapter has more, each built on the chapter’s own datasets.
- **Introduction and Summary follow the *Tutorials for Books* article.**
  The Introduction’s first sentence: “This tutorial covers [Chapter N:
  Title](https://ppbds.github.io/ims.tutorials/url) from [*Introduction
  to Modern Statistics*](https://openintrostat.github.io/ims/) by Mine
  Çetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin.” Then one sentence on what
  students will learn. The Summary repeats that paragraph in the past
  tense, then points to one or two of the best further readings, ideally
  a source the chapter cites that an earlier knowledge drop already
  mentioned. Its last paragraph acknowledges the book: “Many sentences
  in this tutorial, and its figures, come from the chapter, used under
  the book’s [CC BY-SA 3.0
  license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).” Say “its
  figure” when there is one, and drop the figures clause when there are
  none.
- **Knowledge drops copy the chapter.** Pick the chapter’s most
  important sentences, its definitions and its warnings, and copy them,
  without quotation marks (see *Use the book’s own words*), so the
  student meets the book’s exact wording. The other drop sentence ties
  the book’s sentence to what the student’s output just showed. Never
  more than two sentences.
- **The chapter’s own summary appears in the tutorial.** Most chapters
  end with a “Chapter review” whose Summary paragraph is the authors’
  own statement of what the chapter taught. The tutorial’s Summary
  section copies it, as plain prose with no block quote or introduction,
  between the past-tense paragraph and the further readings. The Summary
  must match what the tutorial actually did, so cut any claim about
  material the tutorial never covered (Chapter 4’s “mosaic plots, pie
  charts”, Chapter 19’s ANOVA and paired means, which come in later
  tutorials). Where it says “chapter,” write “tutorial”: “This chapter
  introduced you to the world of data” becomes “This tutorial introduced
  you to the world of data,” and “In the next chapter” becomes “In the
  next tutorial.” A reference to a figure or a numbered chapter is
  reworded the same way, or cut. The Applications chapters have no
  Chapter review, so their tutorials have no such paragraph.
- **Simulation uses infer.** Part 4 teaches inference by randomization
  and the bootstrap before the mathematical model. Our answer chunks
  simulate with **[infer](https://infer.netlify.app/)**, whose verbs
  (specify, hypothesize, generate, calculate) match the book’s
  vocabulary and OpenIntro’s own tutorials. Students’ AI may write the
  simulation any way it likes; what they compare is the result.
- **Students only code, using AI.** There are no multiple-choice or quiz
  questions (base guide §3). Each concept the chapter defines is taught
  by an exercise whose output displays it: averaging `interest_rate`
  shows what makes a variable numerical, and counting the levels of
  `grade` shows a categorical one. The knowledge drop then names the
  concept in the book’s words.
- **Override: help-page exercises are rare.** *Tutorials for Books* has
  students run `?dataset` and paste part of the help page for every
  dataset. Most of these exercises waste the student’s time. Each of the
  first three tutorials (Chapters 1 to 3) has exactly one, and later
  tutorials have none. Pick the dataset whose help page teaches
  something, such as `?stent365`, which misstates when the outcomes were
  measured. Our answer is the relevant excerpt. A fact from a help page
  can still appear in a knowledge drop without an exercise (“The help
  page says the smoking ban data ‘were from a variety of sources.’”).
- **Override: one exercise per library.** The base guide (§4,
  Introduction step 2) loads every library in one exercise. Here each
  library gets its own exercise, per *Tutorials for Books*, adding to
  the setup chunk in turn. Each is a knowledge-drop opportunity about
  that package’s place in the book.
- **Override: no interpretation exercises.** The base guide (§4,
  *Analysis path*) asks for a written interpretation after each major
  plot. Here students only code, so the takeaway goes in the plot’s
  subtitle instead, written as part of the plot-improvement exercise,
  per *Tutorials in the Age of AI*. Each topic ends with a plot built in
  one exercise and improved in the next.
- **Override: no caching.** The base guide (§2, *Caching*) walks every
  tutorial through a three-exercise cache arc. Students learned caching
  before these tutorials, and the focus here is statistics, so no
  tutorial caches a chunk, adds `analysis_cache` to `.gitignore`, or has
  a clean-up exercise that exists only to prepare for caching.

## learnr2, not learnr

Each tutorial is a Quarto document, `inst/tutorials/<name>/<name>.qmd`,
with `format: live-html` and `engine: knitr`. Questions, the
student-information block, and the download button are
[`learnr2::question()`](https://ppbds.github.io/learnr2/reference/question.html),
[`learnr2::student_info()`](https://ppbds.github.io/learnr2/reference/student_info.html),
and
[`learnr2::download_answers_button()`](https://ppbds.github.io/learnr2/reference/download_answers_button.html)
calls in `{r}` chunks with `#| echo: false`. **Read learnr2’s
[`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/PPBDS/learnr2/blob/main/AGENTS.md)
before writing a tutorial** — it is the authoring guide for the file
format (frontmatter, chunk labels, exercises, hints, solutions, quizzes,
the `webr: packages:` list, and the traps). Use
[`learnr2::create_tutorial()`](https://ppbds.github.io/learnr2/reference/create_tutorial.html)
or copy an existing tutorial here as a starting point. Never add
[`library(learnr)`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/),
[`library(tutorial.helpers)`](https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/),
child documents, or a `tutorial: id:` field.

The `_extensions/` directory is added at render time by
[`learnr2::run_tutorial()`](https://ppbds.github.io/learnr2/reference/run_tutorial.html);
it is git-ignored and build-ignored, never committed.

## Relationship to the base tutorial guide

The base guide
([`claude-md/tutorials/CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/PPBDS/ai-rules/blob/main/claude-md/tutorials/CLAUDE.md))
is the default contract for this package, and **`ims.tutorials` follows
it in full**; where it conflicts with learnr2’s own guide, the base
guide wins (see the mapping below). These are normal tutorials: a
statistics topic explored through data, with the full analysis path (get
data, explore it, build a plot or table, interpret, publish), the
`analysis.qmd` working chunk, render + Live Server, CP/CR, and the
standard Introduction/Summary structure. Read the base guide first.

### How the base guide maps onto learnr2

`inst/tutorials/hello-data/` is the reference implementation of this
mapping and of everything in this file; copy its patterns.

- **The student workflow is unchanged.** Students work in a Codespace on
  their own `analysis.qmd`, render with Live Server, commit, and submit
  `show_file()` output with CP/CR. learnr2’s “no local R dependency”
  rule is about the tutorial *page*, not the student; its AGENTS.md says
  so explicitly.
- **`show_file()` comes from learnr2, not tutorial.helpers.** It is
  installed with this package (learnr2 is in `Imports`), and the
  standing note on the first `show_file()` exercise names
  [`library(learnr2)`](https://github.com/PPBDS/learnr2). For a file
  with code chunks it shows only the last chunk by default, so the
  evidence call is `show_file("analysis.qmd")`, with no `chunk`
  argument. Files without chunks, like `.gitignore`, print whole by
  default. No tutorial asks for the whole QMD (`start = 0`) any more:
  per the base guide’s *Summary exercises*, the Summary’s first exercise
  is a final render, commit and push, answered with the URL of
  `analysis.qmd` on GitHub, and there is no separate repo-URL exercise.
- **Questions** are `type = "reflection"`, which locks the answer once
  submitted, and the question’s text carries the whole instruction:
  `learnr2::question('In the R Terminal, run show_file("analysis.qmd"). CP/CR.', type = "reflection")`.
  This follows learnr2’s “submit once, then locked” rule: we show our
  answer right after the student’s, and an editable box invites copying
  ours back in. Question text is plain text, so commands in it have no
  backticks; quote the R string with single quotes when the command
  contains double quotes. The exercise’s prose above the chunk states
  the goal (“Render.”), and the question says what to run and paste.
  Help-page questions put the whole instruction in the text (“In the R
  Terminal, run ?mlb. Copy and paste the Description.”), and URL
  questions are just “Paste the URL of your published page.” Only the
  minutes question at the end uses `type = "reflection_editable"`.
  learnr2 disables each Continue button until every question above it is
  submitted.
- **Pacing.** learnr2 gates every `##`/`###` section behind a Continue
  button, and a bare `###` line renders as an empty section, so the base
  guide’s two `###` dividers (question → our answer → knowledge drop)
  work unchanged. `toc-depth: 2` keeps the dividers and `### Exercise N`
  headings out of the sidebar.
- **Our answers** are render-time `{r}` chunks with `#| echo: true`, as
  in the base guide, backed by a hidden setup chunk
  (`#| include: false`) that loads the tidyverse. learnr2 allows these
  “our answer” chunks; every package they use must be in `Suggests`. No
  [webr](https://github.com/cardiomoon/webr) cells; the base guide’s ban
  on exercise code chunks stands.
- **Chunk labels** follow the base guide’s `section-name-N` (question)
  and `section-name-N-test` (answer) format. The question’s label is its
  learnr2 `id`. learnr2’s vignette suggests `-answer` for the answer
  chunk; we keep `-test`, which is only cosmetic, so existing tutorials
  need no renaming.
- **Code blocks follow learnr2’s convention**, which `check_tutorial()`
  enforces. A command to type is tagged with its language
  (```` ```bash ```` for `quarto render` and `quarto publish`);
  something to type with no language, like a URL to download, is tagged
  `default`; anything the student compares against (an `ls` listing, a
  help page excerpt, the `.gitignore` answer, a `git log`) is tagged
  `{.output}`. Our answer for a `show_file()` question that is not a
  live chunk (the setup chunk, a cleaned-up cached chunk) goes in a
  four-backtick ````` ````{verbatim} ````` block, which shows chunk
  fences without running them. Never a bare ```` ``` ```` fence, and
  never `<pre><code>` with `&#96;` entities.
- **No install exercises.** Every package a tutorial uses, including the
  book’s data packages (**openintro**, **usdata**, and others), goes in
  `Suggests` in DESCRIPTION. The student image installs each course
  package’s `Suggests`, so students never install packages by hand.

Unlike `vscode.tutorials`, there is **no mechanics exception**. Students
arrive having done `vscode.tutorials` through the Quarto tutorial — the
boundary the base guide assumes — and nothing here re-teaches those
mechanics. When a tutorial needs a skill not taught through Quarto,
scaffold it explicitly or fix it upstream; never assume it silently.

### Choosing topics

The base guide (§7) leaves topic choice to each project. Here, the topic
of each tutorial is one chapter of *Introduction to Modern Statistics*,
including the “Applications” chapters (see *One tutorial per chapter*,
above). Use the chapter’s own datasets; when a dataset hides a
discoverable anomaly, as `county` does with Kalawao County’s 0%
homeownership, build an exercise that lets the student find it.

### The universal entry point

Same as every package: open a Codespace on `main` from
`PPBDS/codespace-starter`, then start the tutorial from the R Tutorials
extension. Every tutorial’s intro uses the standard repo line: *“You
should be doing this tutorial in a repo named `whatever`. If you are
not, create one and then connect to it.”* Do not add the old third
sentence, “You may need to restart this tutorial after you do so.” It
was a learnr limitation that learnr2 does not have.

## Authoring conventions

The project-wide syntactic conventions apply exactly as in the base
guide:

- **Per-chunk options use Quarto’s `#| key: value` syntax**, never
  inline `, key = value` on the header — including `#| label:`, which
  every chunk needs.

### Terminal terminology

Use the fixed vocabulary taught in `vscode.tutorials`: **Panel** (the
bottom region), **the Terminal** (the Terminal view in the Panel),
**terminal** (one session, selected by its **tab**), **bash Terminal** /
**R Terminal**. Instructions always name which one — “In the bash
Terminal, run `quarto render analysis.qmd`” — never bare “the Terminal.”

## Consistency rules

### The bash prompt in example answers

`codespace-starter` sets `PS1='\W \$ '`, so the prompt is the basename
of the working directory, a space, and a dollar sign: `hello-data $`.
Never GitHub’s stock long prompt, never a bare `$`. The home directory
is `/home/rstudio` (prompt `~ $`).

### Repo names derive from tutorial titles

Every tutorial uses its own work repo, named after its **title**:
lowercase, with each run of spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters
collapsed to a single dash (“Hello Data” → `hello-data`, “Applications:
Data” → `applications-data`). When a title changes, update the repo-name
instruction, every prompt line, every `/workspaces/<name>` path, and
every URL (`github.com/<user>/<name>`, `<user>.github.io/<name>/`). Do
not change the directory name, `.qmd` file name, or chunk labels (a
`question()` chunk’s label is the key for the student’s saved answer). A
title must never map to `codespace-starter`.

### Refer to tutorials by title, not number

In prose, refer to a tutorial by its **title**, never its directory
name. Reserve the directory name for paths, URLs, `run_tutorial()`
calls, and ids. Quote a title written out as a title (*the next
tutorial, “Study Design,” covers…*); short attributive references (the
Hello Data tutorial) stay unquoted.

### Renaming tutorials (directory renames)

Tutorial directories are `inst/tutorials/<slug>/`, holding `<slug>.qmd`.
A tutorial’s place in the list is its YAML `ordering:`, so reordering
never renames anything. Renaming a directory fans out:

1.  `learnr2::run_tutorial(name = "<slug>", ...)` calls in README.Rmd
    (re-render README.md after editing) and inside tutorials.
2.  Files students download from GitHub must **not** live under a
    tutorial directory. Keep them in `inst/extdata/`, so a rename never
    changes the URL, with an identical copy in the tutorial’s `data/`
    directory for its answer chunks to read. Add a check for each such
    URL, and for the two copies matching, in
    `tests/testthat/test-downloads.R`.
3.  Cross-references in prose, README.Rmd’s tutorial list, the tutorial
    list in `R/ims.tutorials-package.R` (run `devtools::document()`
    after), and this file.
4.  The `.qmd` file name and the `filename_prefix` of
    `download_answers_button()` — both **must always equal the directory
    name.**

NEWS.md entries are historical records — never retro-renumber them.

### Adding a tutorial

1.  Create `inst/tutorials/<slug>/<slug>.qmd`, with `learnr2:` /
    `ordering: <chapter>` in the YAML header and
    `download_answers_button(filename_prefix = "<slug>")`.
2.  List every non-base package its
    [webr](https://github.com/cardiomoon/webr) cells use under
    `webr: packages:` in the frontmatter, and add any package its `{r}`
    chunks use to `Suggests` in DESCRIPTION. Students’ devcontainer
    image has only what the course packages declare, and the
    `student-env-render` CI job fails if a tutorial needs something
    undeclared.
3.  List it in README.Rmd (re-render README.md) and in
    `R/ims.tutorials-package.R` (re-run `devtools::document()`).
4.  If the chapter gives its data only as a table or counts, write it as
    a CSV with the chapter’s exact numbers to both `inst/extdata/<file>`
    and `inst/tutorials/<slug>/data/<file>`, with a `data/README.txt`
    recording where the numbers come from (build-ignored, so it stays in
    the repo but not the package). The tutorial downloads it from
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/ims.tutorials/main/inst/extdata/<file>`
    and reads `data/<file>`; add both checks to
    `tests/testthat/test-downloads.R`.

### The devcontainer image pin (`ghcr.io/ppbds/devcontainer:X.Y.Z`)

`.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml`‘s `student-env-render` job runs in
the image students’ Codespaces use. Keep its tag in sync with the
`"image"` pin in [PPBDS/codespace-starter
`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](https://github.com/PPBDS/codespace-starter/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).
