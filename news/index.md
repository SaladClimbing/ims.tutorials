# Changelog

## ims.tutorials (development version)

- Every Summary’s first exercise is now a final render, commit and push,
  answered with the URL of `analysis.qmd` on GitHub, in place of the
  whole-file `show_file("analysis.qmd", start = 0)` paste. The separate
  repo-URL exercise is gone; the file URL contains it. Each tutorial is
  one exercise shorter.

## ims.tutorials 0.0.0.9004

- Knowledge drops now show the book’s own diagrams: 63 figures across 21
  tutorials, such as the tree of variable types in Hello Data, the
  sampling pictures in Study Design, and the randomization and bootstrap
  schematics from Chapter 11 on. Plots of the chapters’ data are never
  copied. Students build those.

- The tutorials copy the book’s sentences as their own prose, without
  quotation marks, and credit the book once, in the last paragraph of
  each Summary. Each chapter’s own summary paragraph is now plain text,
  not a block quote, with “chapter” changed to “tutorial”, and trimmed
  where it described material the tutorial never covers (Chapters 4, 7,
  18, and 19). The figures and sentences stay under the book’s CC BY-SA
  3.0 license, recorded in `inst/COPYRIGHTS`, `LICENSE.md`, and the
  DESCRIPTION `Copyright:` field.

- Help-page exercises (`?dataset`) are cut to one in each of the first
  three tutorials and none after. Caching exercises are gone from every
  tutorial: students learned caching earlier, and these tutorials teach
  statistics. Tutorials are about four exercises shorter as a result.

- Knowledge drops are shorter and plainer throughout. The Introduction
  no longer says “You may need to restart this tutorial after you do
  so,” which learnr2 does not require.

- Fixed Summary answers that did not match the student’s finished
  `analysis.qmd`, in several tutorials: a missing chunk, or a chunk the
  student had already replaced.

- New tests check that every image a tutorial references exists and is
  used, that every tutorial credits the book’s license, and that no
  tutorial caches or has more help-page exercises than allowed.

- Tutorial directories no longer carry a chapter-number prefix
  (`hello-data`, not `01-hello-data`); each tutorial’s place in the list
  is the `ordering:` field in its YAML header, read by learnr2 0.1.3.
  Chapter 7 is `linear-regression-single` and Chapter 8
  `linear-regression-multiple`, keeping package paths under the 100-byte
  limit for portable tarballs.

- Code blocks follow learnr2’s convention: commands are tagged with
  their language, expected output is tagged `{.output}`, and displayed
  chunks use `{verbatim}` blocks instead of `<pre><code>`.

- Each tutorial’s Summary now quotes the chapter’s own Summary
  paragraph, for the chapters that have one.

- Added six tutorials, the companions to Chapters 11 through 16:
  Hypothesis Testing with Randomization
  (`hypothesis-testing-randomization`), Confidence Intervals with
  Bootstrapping (`confidence-intervals-bootstrap`), Inference with
  Mathematical Models (`inference-mathematical-models`), Decision Errors
  (`decision-errors`), Applications: Foundations
  (`applications-foundations`), and Inference for a Single Proportion
  (`inference-for-a-single-proportion`).

- Added eleven tutorials, the companions to Chapters 17 through 27, so
  every chapter of the book now has one: Inference for Comparing Two
  Proportions, Inference for Two-Way Tables, Inference for a Single
  Mean, Inference for Comparing Two Independent Means, Inference for
  Comparing Paired Means, Inference for Comparing Many Means,
  Applications: Infer, Inference for Linear Regression with a Single
  Predictor, Inference for Linear Regression with Multiple Predictors,
  Inference for Logistic Regression, and Applications: Model and Infer.

- Added **cherryblossom** and **palmerpenguins** to `Suggests`, for
  `run17` in Chapter 19 and `penguins` in Chapter 25.

- Every tutorial now uses only its own chapter’s data. Study Design
  replaces `malaria`, which Chapter 2 never uses, with the stent study
  it discusses, and Applications: Explore replaces `county` with Chapter
  6’s company expenses and its real 2010 Duke hiring counts. Chapters
  that give data only as counts ship them as CSVs in `inst/extdata/`,
  and `test-downloads.R` now checks every such file.

- Trimmed the knowledge drops that ran past two sentences.

- Added **infer** to `Suggests`, used by the simulation answer chunks
  from Chapter 11 on.

## ims.tutorials 0.0.0.9002

- Tutorial directories drop their two-digit chapter prefix
  (`01-hello-data` is now `hello-data`); each tutorial’s YAML header
  sets `learnr2: ordering:` to its chapter number instead, which fixes
  its place in the tutorial list.

- Added five tutorials, the companions to Chapters 6 through 10 of
  *Introduction to Modern Statistics*: Applications: Explore
  (`06-applications-explore`), Linear Regression with a Single Predictor
  (`07-linear-regression-single`), Linear Regression with Multiple
  Predictors (`08-linear-regression-multiple`), Logistic Regression
  (`09-logistic-regression`), and Applications: Model
  (`10-applications-model`).

- Applications: Explore has students download the chapter’s Brexit poll
  from `inst/extdata/brexit.csv`. A new test checks that the URL works
  and that the tutorial’s own copy matches it.

- Added **broom** and **scales** to `Suggests`, used by the new
  tutorials’ answer chunks, and **httr2**, used by the download test.

- Every question now locks once submitted (`type = "reflection"`), and
  its text carries the whole instruction, such as running
  `show_file("analysis.qmd")` and pasting the result. This follows
  learnr2’s “submit once, then locked” rule. Students must also submit
  each question before the next Continue button works. Only the minutes
  question stays editable.

- Removed the Histograms tutorial (`06-histograms`) merged in pull
  request [\#2](https://github.com/PPBDS/ims.tutorials/issues/2). It
  duplicated Chapter 6’s slot, which belongs to Applications: Explore,
  covered ground Exploring Numerical Data already covers, and used
  in-browser exercises and editable answers that this package does not.
  Its CLAUDE.md section, which said learnr2 has no `show_file()`, was
  dropped too. The tutorial remains in the git history.

- Renamed the package from `stat101.tutorials` to `ims.tutorials`,
  matching the GitHub repository.

- Added four tutorials, the companions to Chapters 2 through 5 of
  *Introduction to Modern Statistics*: Study Design (`02-study-design`),
  Applications: Data (`03-applications-data`), Exploring Categorical
  Data (`04-exploring-categorical-data`), and Exploring Numerical Data
  (`05-exploring-numerical-data`).

- Added **ggridges** and **maps** to `Suggests`, for the ridge plot in
  Exploring Categorical Data and the county intensity map in Exploring
  Numerical Data. The student devcontainer image already carries both,
  via `misc.tutorials`.
